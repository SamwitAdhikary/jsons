Users can write small programs, or scripts, that run in the command line 'shell' to perform everyday tasks like renaming files or processing text. Like the best-selling first edition, this revision of Wicked Cool Shell Scripts provides the full source code for over 100 short shell scripts that solve common problems, can be used to personalize a user's computing environment, and are just plain entertaining. The tools include an interactive calculator, a stock tracker, a password manager, a weather checker, and a website search engine."
