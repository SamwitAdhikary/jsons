Each recipe includes code that you can copy and paste into a toy dataset to ensure that it actually works. From there, you can insert, combine, or adapt the code to help construct your application. Recipes also include a discussion that explains the solution and provides meaningful context. This cookbook takes you beyond theory and concepts by providing the nuts and bolts you need to construct working machine learning applications. You'll find recipes for: Vectors, matrices, and arrays Handling numerical and categorical data, text, images, and dates and times Dimensionality reduction using feature extraction or feature selection Model evaluation and selection Linear and logical regression, trees and forests, and k-nearest neighbors Support vector machines (SVM), naive Bayes, clustering, and neural networks Saving and loading trained models"
