Assuming the reader has no prior familiarity with computer graphics, the authors present basic principles for design, use, and understanding of computer graphics systems. The authors are widely considered authorities in computer graphics, and are known for their accessible writing style. A free Open GL supplement is available via the texts Prentice Hall Catalog page."

Focusing on the Internet and the fundamentally important issues of networking, this text provides an excellent foundation for readers interested in computer science and electrical engineering, without requiring extensive knowledge of programming or mathematics. The Seventh Edition has been updated to reflect the most important and exciting recent advances in networking."
