Best-selling programming author Herb Schildt covers the entire Java language, including its syntax, keywords, and fundamental programming principles. You’ll also find information on key portions of the Java API library, such as I/O, the Collections Framework, the stream library, and the concurrency utilities. Swing, JavaBeans, and servlets are examined and numerous examples demonstrate Java in action. Of course, the very important module system is discussed in detail. This Oracle Press resource also offers an introduction to JShell, Java’s interactive programming tool. Best of all, the book is written in the clear, crisp, uncompromising style that has made Schildt the choice of millions worldwide."
