Java Program Design presents program design principles to help practicing programmers up their game and remain relevant in the face of changing trends and an evolving language. The book enhances the traditional design patterns with Java's new functional programming features, such as functional interfaces and lambda expressions. The result is a fresh treatment of design patterns that expands their power and applicability, and reflects current best practice."

Learn Java the Easy Way takes the chore out of learning Java with hands-on projects that will get you building real, functioning apps right away. You’ll start by familiarizing yourself with JShell, Java’s interactive command line shell that allows programmers to run single lines of code and get immediate feedback. Then, you’ll create a guessing game, a secret message encoder, and a multitouch bubble-drawing app for both desktop and mobile devices using Eclipse, an industry-standard IDE, and Android Studio, the development environment for making Android apps."
